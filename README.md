# PSC-RTE

We put the "Bilan RÃ©union" and other discussions in the "Issues".

The file Cplex_solving_in_txt.ipynb uses CPLEX to resolve all the problems and give total execution time. The solutions are written in txt files.

The file Cplex_solving_in_dataframe.ipynb uses CPLEX to resolve all the problems and give total execution time. The solutions are gathered in a dataframe.

The file Cplex_solving_in_pickle.ipynb uses CPLEX to resolve all the problems and give total execution time. The solutions are gathered in a pickle, in which contains aussi the code for extracting data in form matrix, wherever the second method will give the different form of duplicated matrice.
