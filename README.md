# PSC-RTE

We put the "Bilan Réunion" and other discussions in the "Issues".

The file Cplex_solving_in_txt.ipynb uses CPLEX to resolve all the problems and give total execution time. The solutions are written in txt files.

The file Cplex_solving_in_dataframe.ipynb uses CPLEX to resolve all the problems and give total execution time. The solutions are gathered in a dataframe.

The file Cplex_solving_in_pickle.ipynb uses CPLEX to resolve all the problems and give total execution time. The solutions are gathered in a pickle, in which contains aussi the code for extracting data in form matrix, wherever the second method will give the different form of duplicated matrice.

data.py and NeuralNetwork.py contain basic classes and methods for both datasets and Neural Networks.
